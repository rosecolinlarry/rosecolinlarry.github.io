# Yet Another Angular Website

## 🤔 What Am I?

Experimenting with different ways to make a website. Currently using Angular and `nx`.

## 🫥 Who Am I?

Kaisa.

## ⏳ When Am I?

Check the copyright in the footer.

## 🗺️ Where Am I?

As cool as it would be for extraterrestrials to be visiting my website, I assume Earth.

## 👋 How Am I?

Good, you?

## 🪴 Why Am I?

1. Wix has a 500mb limit and I am looking into hosting my own website for my portfolio (which has a lot of images, putting me over that limit)
2. Practicing my skills outside of work because it is both fun and I will hopefully be able to convince the teams to use `nx` and implement darkmode. If I am an expert, it will be easy to implement with little risk to dealines.
3. This is fun.
4. 
#### Things I would like to explore:
- Hosting a web game made in Godot
- Implementing a basic ERP and/or CSR system
- Adding a settings page for more custom theming
- Fun drag-and-drop potion screen, similar to potion craft, but using only HTML and css
- Incorporate AI... somehow
- Google Place API integration
- Create a backend and API this website calls to. Maybe hosted with Vercel?
